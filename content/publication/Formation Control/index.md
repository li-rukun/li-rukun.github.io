abstract: This paper addresses the leader-follower formation control of switched uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems under the condition that the abrupt parameter and communication topology change. Distributed formation tracking performance is achieved through the design of ap-propriate sliding mode variables, which encompass the communication interactions among the robots, and a sufficient condition regarding the switching time among subsystems is derived. First, the networked Euler-Lagrange systems are modeled as switched Lagrange systems, and then a distributed leader-follower formation control strategy is developed based on the average dwell time (ADT). The Lyapunov stable theory performs the closed-loop stable analysis and the simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control techniques.
